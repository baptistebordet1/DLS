So the idea for the arduino code is to have commands comming from the python code which will be interpreted by the arduino with switches. 

The code is decomposed as following : 

Declaration of variables. 
Setup : 
Here there is the classic stuff each pin is declared as input or output, initialisation of the serial connection, then initialisation of the attenuation motor position 
and move the motor to the fully attenuated position. 
Main loop :
Wait for commands to arrive two types of commands :
Move  : MAP55 M -> move, A -> Attenuator, P positive direction in regards of trigonometric direction, 55 -> number of steps. returns the new position and send it to serial connection  
Read  : RT R -> read, T -> turntable return the absolute encoder value

for move of turntable every X rotation of the motor (to be determined in function of the reduction ratio) the position is read from the encoder and send to the python code. 
the angle are always send in decimal for the absolute encoder (so the calibration for the 0° point can be changed in the python without having to reset the arduino code) 
and they are send in degrees for the attenuator motor because the 0° point is actually determind at each initialisation. 

Things to do arduino code :

Test if the rotation direction of the turntable motor is correct
Determine the reduction ratio
