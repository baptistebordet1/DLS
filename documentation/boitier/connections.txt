File Containing all the connections inside the DLS powering box :

First let's consider the connections between the Arduino and the rest of the componnents inside the box
Format is Arduino Pins : Component pin and then information about the connection 

Interrupt Pins : 

PIN 2 : Pollolu FAULT pin simple cable
PIN 3 : Pollolu STALL/BEMFV pin simple cable 
PIN 19 : LeadShine motor driver ALM, don't forget to add a load (see documentation for this)  
GND : LeadShine motor driver COM- 
PIN 20 : Limit switch 1 
PIN 21 : Limit switch 2
+5V : Limit switch 1 and 2 On mounted Pannel 

Motor Pins : 
PIN 4 : Chip Select Pollolu Driver 
PIN 5 : Dir Pin Pollolu Driver 
PIN 6 : Step Pin Pollolu Driver, Needs to be shielded alone  
PIN 7 : PUL+ Pin LeadSHine Driver, Needs to be shielded alone 
PIN 8 : DIR + Pin LeadShine Driver
PIN 9 : Clock Positiv absolute encoder PIN 4 of the encoder (see schematics for more information) 
Pin 10 : Clock Negativ absolute encoder PIN 5 of the encoder 
PIN 11 : Data Positiv absolute encoder PIN 2 of the encoder 
PIN 12 : Data Negativ absolute encoder PIN 3 of the encoder 
PIN 13 : Sense absolute encoder PIN 6 of the encoder 
PIN 22 : Reset Pololu driver
+5V with a 390Ohms resistor Phototransitor pin associated with Brown cable on the other end 
+5V with a 100kOhms into red wire for photontransitor PIN 

Sensors Pins : 

PIN 23 : Phototransistor pin look at schematics for more info 
PIN 24 : Relay SIG Pin 

Then the connections between the components and other devices than Arduino : 

+15V and GND to Encoder PIN 7 and 1 
+24V and GND to LeadShine Powering 
+12V and GND to Pololu VIN and GND 
+24V to Normally Open (NO) PIN on relay (and GND)

USb to Arduino 
4 Wires from Pollolu OUTPUTS (AOUT1, AOUT2, BOUT1, BOUT2) to PIN 1,2,3,4 for Monted Pannel 7 PINS with Phototransistor 
4 Wires from LeadShine OUTPUTS (A+, A-, B+, B-) to PIN 1,2,3,4 for monted Pannel 4 PIns
